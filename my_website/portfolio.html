<p>Reflection:The obective of my game is similar to that of an intense version of "don't let the balloon touch the floor." <br>
As the player progresses, more flyers fall from the sky, forcing him/ her to juggle multiple at once. If a flyer touches the <br>
dirt, then it is game over. To add more flyers, I used the broadcast option. If a flyer was caught, then it would broadcast <br>
level 2, and so forth. To manipulate the speed and direction of the sprites, I added two variables for each flyer. I incorporated <br>
them into the "if then" coding blocks so if the flyer was caught, the direction would change from -1 to 1, and the speed would increase <br>
by a given decimal. One problem I came across was getting the game over screen to appear in the right position. I realized that <br>
I just needed to set the x and y to 0 so that it wouold be centered. </p>

<p>Reflection: In my story, the player is in the world of pokemon and must choose the correct path in order to become the best <br>
pokemon trainer. If they don't choose the correct path, they will have an unfortunate fate as result of their incompetence. <br>
To create the story, my partner and I defined functions where decision points were to be made. We then used if else statements to <br>
navigate the player based on the options they chose. Some problems we encountered while coding the story were correct indentation, <br>
and remembering to use colons. If it didnt work when we ran it, we would just go back and fix the errors. I thought this activity was <br>
fun because the story changed based on which option you chose. Two stories I thought were entertaining were Cynical and Savage because <br>
of the creativity of the endings. If I were to do this again, I would make it an original story. </p>
