<p>Reflection:The obective in my game is similar to that of an intense version of "don't let the balloon touch the floor." <br>
As the player progresses, more flyers fall from the sky, forcing him/ her to juggle multiple at once. If a flyer touches the <br>
dirt, then it is game over. To add more flyers, I used the broadcast option. If a flyer was caught, then it would broadcast <br>
level 2, and so forth. To manipulate the speed and direction of the sprites, I added two variables for each flyer. I incorporated <br>
them into the "if then" coding blocks so if the flyer was caught, the direction would change from -1 to 1, and the speed would increase <br>
by a given decimal. One problem I came across was getting the game over screen to appear in the right position. I realized that <br>
I just needed to set the x and y to 0 so that it wouold be centered. </p>
